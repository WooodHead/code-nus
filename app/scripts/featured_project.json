                        NUS Modifications (NUSMods) was founded in 2012 to\
                        provide a better way for students to plan their school\
                        timetables. In August, it had 65,000 devices, 400,000\
                        sessions and 1.6 million page views. It is widely used\
                        by the school students for timetable scheduling and\
                        getting comprehensive information regarding modules.\
                        We plan to add more social features such as timetable\
                        sharing and discussion forums.\
