                        Sometimes a song on Spotify disappears for no reason and you\
                        wonder if it'd been completely pulled from the catalogue or\
                        maybe it's still available on some regions. This nice little hack\
                        from Jerome makes use of the Spotify API to solve this problem.\
                        </p>"
