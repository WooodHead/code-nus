# About

## What

As an NUS student, do you ever want to build something and wonder if your peers
have already done it? Perhaps instead of starting afresh, it may be a better
idea to collaborate with that persons? You can make new friends, and learn from
someone who may be (slightly) more experienced than you. Even if not, maybe you
can find out more about the problems you may face when partaking the project.

This is where Code@NUS comes in. We aim to be the central repository for NUS
folks to showcase and promote their open-source projects, making the discovery
easy and fast.

To that end, we have made this whole platform hackable - you can send us pull
request for practically anything you see on this website. The source code is
available on github: [https://github.com/nushackers/code-
nus](https://github.com/nushackers/code-nus). Even adding your project requires
a pull request =). To find out more, head over to [our guide]('/how_to') for
more details.

## Who

Code@NUS is maintained by [NUS Hackers](http://nushackers.org), but anyone is welcomed to [contribute](https://github.com/nushackers/code-nus)!
