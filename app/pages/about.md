# About

## What

As an NUS student, have you ever wanted to build something and wondered if your peers
had already done it? Perhaps instead of starting afresh, it might be a better
idea to collaborate with others. You could make new friends, learn from
someone who may be (even slightly) more experienced than you, and maybe just
find out more about the problems you may face.

This is where Code@NUS comes in. We aim to be the central repository for NUS
folks to showcase and promote their open-source projects, making discovery
easy and fast.

To that end, we have made this whole platform hackable - you can send us pull
requests for practically anything you see on this website. The source code is
available on GitHub: [https://github.com/nushackers/code-nus](https://github.com/nushackers/code-nus).
Even adding your project requires a pull request =). To find out more, head over
to [our guide](/how_to) for more details.

## Who

Code@NUS is maintained by [NUS Hackers](http://nushackers.org), but anyone is welcome to [contribute](https://github.com/nushackers/code-nus)!
