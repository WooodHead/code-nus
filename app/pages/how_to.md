## Adding your project

Right now, we only support GitHub projects - if you feel strongly about using a different platform, let us know by either [opening an issue](https://github.com/nushackers/code-nus/issues) or [contacting us directly](http://nushackers.org/contact/).

To add your projects, head over to [https://github.com/nushackers/code-nus-repos](https://github.com/nushackers/code-nus-repos) and fork the repository. Then follow [these instructions](https://github.com/nushackers/code-nus-repos#adding-your-project) to add your project and send us a pull request. We'll review the request to check that everything is set, then deploy it; your project will appear on the site soon after that!

## Fixing bugs & requesting features

If you find something wrong or have some features you'd like to see, there are two
things you can do:

1. Fork the repository [https://github.com/nushackers/code-nus](https://github.com/nushackers/code-nus), fix the bug/add in the feature and send us a pull request.
2. [Open an issue](https://github.com/nushackers/code-nus/issues) and describe what's wrong/what could bee better.

Method 1 is highly preferred =), but if you are too busy/not sure what to do, feel free to go through method 2 so we know there's something we can do.
