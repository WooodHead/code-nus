#How to contribute?

## Adding your project

Right now, we only support github projects - if you feel strongly about using a different platform, let us know by either [opening an issue](https://github.com/nushackers/code-nus/issues) or [contacting us directly](http://nushackers.org/contact/).

Otherwise, we assume that your project is on github, and therefore, you already
have an github account.

So, head over to [https://github.com/nushackers/code-nus-repos](https://github.com/nushackers/code-nus-repos) and fork the repository. Then follow [the instructions](https://github.com/nushackers/code-nus-repos#adding-your-project) in the repository to add your project and send us a pull request. We will review to make sure that the syntax and content is correct and then deploy it, and your project will appear on this site in a couple of minutes.

## Fixing bugs & requesting features

If you find something wrong or wish there are some features, here are the two
things you can do:

1. Fork the repository [https://github.com/nushackers/code-nus](https://github.com/nushackers/code-nus), fix the bug/add in the feature and send us a pull request.
2. [Open an issue](https://github.com/nushackers/code-nus/issues) and describe what's wrong/what could have been better.

Method 1. is highly preferred =), but if you are too busy/not sure how to do it, at least apply method 2. so we know there's something we can do.
