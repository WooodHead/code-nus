# Frequently Asked Questions

### What type of projects can I put here?

We encourage you to submit a pull request for any side-projects that you think might be beneficial for the NUS community. Be it a web application that gives a cleaner interface to using IVLE or even a set of scripts that might students,

### How do I know if my project is good enough to be on Code@NUS?

Add anything that might be the slightest bit useful for the community! The goal of Code@NUS is to increase students’ awareness of the projects done by NUS students. Adding your project here will help increase awareness of your project and could help you find more contributors.

### Can I add projects that do not belong to me?

Unfortunately, we only accept requests by a project’s author. If you’re adding a project that has a team of contributors, we assume that you’re adding the project with their consent, and on behalf of them.

### How do I add my project?

We have a [guide](/how_to) for you.

### Why should I open source my project?

Firstly, why not? There are reasons for which you may not want to open source -
if there are legal issues or if you want to monetize it, for example. Though
even if your project is commercial, you can still open source it!

On the other hand, open-sourcing your project allows people to help you find and
fix bugs. In the case that you may not be interested in maintaining the project
any more, it's also a lot easier to pass it on to someone else. If people have
ideas to build things on your project, it's also more convenient for them to do
so. It also adds value to your project because the other programmers can now
read your code and learn how you implement certain things.

Open-sourcing your projects on websites like [github](https://github.com) is
also a great way to build up your portfolio and advertise your work. It also
allows your to gauge the level of interest the community (especially your fellow
programmers) have in the project.

### How do I learn git?

Github has a great tutorial on git - [try.github.io](https://try.github.io/) -
give it a try!

### What's a pull request?

Suppose you want to fix a bug in someone else's github repository. Now you can't
really push to that repository because you don't have the write access. You can,
however, fork the repository (that is, copy the repository) and add in your
changes. However, it will be great if you can add your change to the original
repository so more people can benefit from it! This is where pull request comes
in. You can send the original author a "pull request" - a bunch of commits that
you have added to the forked repository, perhaps with some comments. The author
will review it (hopefully!) and if he thinks that it's good to go, the commits
will then be added to the original repository! You can read more about how you can do pull request on Github: [https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests).
