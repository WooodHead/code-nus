# Frequently Asked Questions

<!--toc-->

### What type of projects can I put here?

Pretty much anything you'd like others to see, regardless of if it's related to NUS or not.

### How do I know if my project is good enough to be on Code@NUS?

If someone might find your project useful in **any way** at all, it's good enough. The goal of Code@NUS is to increase awareness of projects done by NUS students, and help you find more contributors.

### Can I add projects that don't belong to me?

Unfortunately, we only accept requests by a project’s author. If you’re adding a project that has a team of contributors, we assume that you’re adding the project with their consent, and on their behalf.

### How do I add my project?

### Why should I open source my project?

Why not? There may be reasons why you may not want to open source -
if there are legal issues with doing so, or if you want to monetize, for example. It's still possible to open source commercial products, though (and many companies do!)

Open-sourcing your project allows people to help you find and fix bugs, and also allows for greater continuity. In the event that you may not be interested in maintaining the project
any more, it's a lot easier to pass it on to someone else; even if you don't explicitly do so, it's also easier for someone else to come along and pick up where you left off.

Open source projects are also much more convenient for others to build upon, which adds value to your project. They're also a great learning tool for other programmers who can now read your code and learn how you did certain things.

Finally, open-sourcing your projects on websites like [GitHub](https://github.com) are a great way to build up your portfolio and advertise your work. It also allows you to gauge the level of interest the community (especially your fellow programmers) have in the project.

### How do I learn git?

GitHub has a great tutorial on git - [give it a try!](https://try.github.io/)

### What's a pull request?

A pull request is essentially a set of commits that someone (maybe you) would like to be merged into another repository.

Suppose you want to fix a bug or add some features to a project in someone else's GitHub repository. You can't push directly to that repository because you don't have write access, but you can fork the repository (that is, make a copy of it) and make your changes there.

However, it would be great if you could have your work merged back into the original
repository so more people can benefit from it! This is where pull requests come
in. You can send the original author a pull request - the series of commits that
you have added to the forked repository, perhaps with some comments. The author
can then review the changes and if they want, merge the commits
into the original repository!

You can read more about how you can make pull requests on GitHub here: [https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests).
